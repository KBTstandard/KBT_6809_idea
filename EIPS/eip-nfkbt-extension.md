## Abstract

The standard is an extension of ERC-6809, Non-Fungible Key Bound Tokens (**NFKBT/s**). It proposes the additional function `customSafeFallback`, allowing asset owners to select and retrieve specific tokens from a smart contract that has NFKBT security activated. 

## Motivation

NFKBTs contain an optional on-chain 2FA security system built directly into the token standard. When activated within they smart contract, all assets within that smart contract are secured, and retrievable. This is achieved via the `safeFallback` function, which curates the transfer of NFKBTs from the holding wallet to the opposite Key wallet that called the function. However, currently the way `safeFallback` works is that it transfers all the NFKBT assets within the given smart contract. There is no option for someone to specify which asset or assets they would like to transfer out of the holding wallet. 

 In the situation where someone owns multiple assets within the same NFKBT collection, the gas fee to call the `safeFallback` function increases based on how many assets they own as each asset accounts for one transfer. The `customSafeFallback` function provides the option to select which NFKBT assets they would like individually, or in batches, transfer out of the holding wallet. Presumably, the most desired assets that hold the most value to the owner could be selectively transferred out, rather than moving all of assets at once and incurring undesired fees from undesired assets. 

## Specification

<!--
  The Specification section should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Ethereum platforms (besu, erigon, ethereumjs, go-ethereum, nethermind, or others).

  It is recommended to follow RFC 2119 and RFC 8170. Do not remove the key word definitions if RFC 2119 and RFC 8170 are followed.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

## Rationale

By standardizing the `customSafeFallback` as an extension, an even more tailored experience is achieved when utilizing NFKBTs built in security. Adding this it doesnâ€™t result in any negative impact or reduce functionality of ERC-6809 smart contracts. The likelihood of someone retrieving assets from a comprised holding wallet would however theoretically increase.

Take this example, someone owns 100 NFKBTS all within the same collection and the security has been activated. While connecting to dApp via the holding wallet, the owner mistakenly connected to a malicious website and now those assets are in stasis as they cannot be unlocked or else they will be stolen. The `safeFallback` function was created for this scenrio, however when attempting to use it the fees far exceed the amount available as its attempting to do 100 transfers. Even if there is only 1 desired asset, calling the function would still require the transfer of all 100 to get the 1.

With the `customSafeFallback` function, a list of `tokenID` can be selected. Rather than transferring all 100, only the specified assets are transferred making the cost far more reasonable and affordable. Truth be told, maybe only a few assets actually have any value and are worth retrieving. 

## Backwards Compatibility

This standard is fully ERC-6809 compatible.

## Test Cases

<!--
  This section is optional for non-Core EIPs.

  The Test Cases section should include expected input/output pairs, but may include a succinct set of executable tests. It should not include project build files. No new requirements may be introduced here (meaning an implementation following only the Specification section should pass all tests here.)
  If the test suite is too large to reasonably be included inline, then consider adding it as one or more files in `../assets/eip-####/`. External links will not be allowed

## Reference Implementation

<!--
  This section is optional.

  The Reference Implementation section should include a minimal implementation that assists in understanding or implementing this specification. It should not include project build files. The reference implementation is not a replacement for the Specification section, and the proposal should still be understandable without it.
  If the reference implementation is too large to reasonably be included inline, then consider adding it as one or more files in `../assets/eip-####/`. External links will not be allowed.

## Security Considerations

<!--
  All EIPs must contain a section that discusses the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for security discussions, surfaces risks and can be used throughout the life cycle of the proposal. For example, include security-relevant design decisions, concerns, important discussions, implementation-specific guidance and pitfalls, an outline of threats and risks and how they are being addressed. EIP submissions missing the "Security Considerations" section will be rejected. An EIP cannot proceed to status "Final" without a Security Considerations discussion deemed sufficient by the reviewers.

  The current placeholder is acceptable for a draft.
